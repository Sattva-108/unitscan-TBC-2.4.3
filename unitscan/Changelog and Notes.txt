- Addon is backported and ready to release.


Known bugs:
First right click per session in combat to close button will make a taint error, then it's fine.


To-Do List:

Fix taint by right click on button in combat to close it.
Add ability to copy names of NPCs in chat after using /unitscan.
Find a way to not add a dead unit to button.
Make keybinds in default Blizzard Keybindings menu for Add/Remove current Target, Click button, Close button.
Add a slash command to disable scanning entirely.
Make scanning in raids optional via slash command, by default disabled.
Add optional model viewer, via slash command, by default disabled.
Add ability to ignore certain rare via slash command.
After adding new commands need to put them into /unitscan help command so that when someone do /unitscan to check for targets he doesnt get spammed with all of them.
